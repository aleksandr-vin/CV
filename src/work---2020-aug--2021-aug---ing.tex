I joined the company as Senior Backend Developer in August 2020 with
the goal to help an existing team develop their Streaming Data
Analytics platform, which is based on Apache Flink and Ververica
Platform. The platform provides real time ML scoring service and
allows tenants write their logic in DSL.
