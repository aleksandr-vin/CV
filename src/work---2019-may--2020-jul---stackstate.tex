\subsection*{May 2019--July 2020}

\textit{Senior Backend Developer at StackState,
\href{https://stackstate.com}{\url{stackstate.com}}, Utrecht, The
Netherlands}

I started with the feature delivering team, whom I was planning to
lead eventually. We delivered some of the core functionalities of the
company's product, like Telemetry Perspective feature and StackPack
(proprietary packages) upgrading feature. And we were participating in
the short-term development of Freemium plan's support features.

During first months I took ownership of the release process,
formalised and automated it, developed a tool to operate the release
process pipeline (put it on GitLab CI) and integrated it with JIRA,
Slack, AWS, JFrog Artifactory, GitLab Pipelines, Quay.io and other
third-party services.

Separately from features development I performed multiple
optimizations to our GitLab pipelines, proposed new erratic tests
handling process, several proof-of-concepts from automation of hotfix
rollouts to optimizing our product Docker images.
