Digital Security at the time I was employed was a small company (about
10 employees), performed security audits for big national industry
companies and developed their brand risk assessment product.

The security team was responsible for onsite technical security audits
and penetration tests. There were occasionally "under-fire" network
tools development in C and Perl for security audit support.

My participation in the project:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep, nosep]
  \item Developing a part of the risk assessment product's core
  \item Designing and starting up the development of a programmable
framework for building scanners for network service's vulnerabilities
\end{itemize}
